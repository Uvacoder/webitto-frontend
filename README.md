Webitto is created as a personal project to help me when building websites and web applications. Many a times you will need to generate assets for PWAs, Favicons etc. There are tons of websites out there which can help you with this.

I found many of them very cluttered and not very user friendly. That's when I had the idea to build Webitto.

## 🔥 Features

- PWA Assets generator
- Favicon generator
- Meta Tags Generator
- WebP Converter
- Image Resizer
- Image Optimizer
- SVG Optimizer

At the moment Webitto only has the PWA Assets generator developed. Other are in the pipeline.
